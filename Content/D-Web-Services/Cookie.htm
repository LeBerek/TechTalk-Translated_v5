        <p>A <MadCap:keyword term="cookie" />cookie in IT is a small piece of data stored on the user’s computer by the web browser while browsing a website. Cookies were designed to be a reliable mechanism for websites to remember stateful information or to record the user’s browsing activity. They also can be used for remembering arbitrary pieces of information that the user previously entered into form fields such as names, addresses, passwords, and credit card numbers</p>
        <p>When working with cookies, it’s important to understand the following :</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cookies are text files with small pieces of data.</li>
            <li>They are used to identify your computer as you use a network.</li>
            <li>Specific cookies are used to identify specific users and improve their web browsing experience.</li>
            <li>Data stored in a cookie is created by the server upon your connection.</li>
            <li>This data is labeled with an ID unique to you and your computer.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Five tasks a cookie may serve for:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Storing user data.</li>
            <li>Tracking user behavior on a website.</li>
            <li>Managing user sessions.</li>
            <li>Personalizing web content.</li>
            <li>Implementing shopping cart functionality.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2 id="cookies-limitations">Cookies limitations</h2>
        <p>Cookies can enhance user experience by remembering user preferences, but they have limitations. They can be a privacy concern if misused to track users without their consent, and they are limited in size, which restricts the amount of data they can store.</p>
        <h2 id="cookies-lifespan">Cookies lifespan</h2>
        <p>Cookies come in two types:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>session cookies, which are temporary and deleted when the browser is closed,</li>
            <li>persistent cookies, which have a set expiration date and stay on the device until they expire or are manually deleted.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The lifespan of a cookie can range from minutes to years. It is determined by the website that sets it and the user’s browser settings.</p>
