        <p class="p-left-border">In the sky, a cloud is a collection of tiny water droplets or ice crystals suspended in the air. In IT, <MadCap:keyword term="cloud" />‘cloud’ refers to cloud computing where services and storage are provided over the internet, enabling users to access data and applications from any device that has internet access.</p>
        <p>The cloud in IT refers to servers that are accessed over the Internet, and the software and databases that run on those servers. Cloud servers are located in data centers all over the world. By using cloud computing, users and companies don’t have to manage physical servers themselves or run software applications on their own machines.Cloud computing is a type of computing that relies on shared computing resources rather than having local servers or personal devices to handle applications.</p>
        <p>When working with cloud, it’s important to understand the following :</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The cloud is a distributed collection of servers that host software and infrastructure.</li>
            <li>It is accessed over the Internet.</li>
            <li>Cloud servers are located in data centers all over the world.</li>
            <li>Cloud computing allows users and companies to not have to manage physical servers themselves or run software applications on their own machines.</li>
            <li>The cloud enables users to access the same files and applications from almost any device.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The five tasks cloud serves for:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Storing data remotely.</li>
            <li>Accessing software over the internet.</li>
            <li>Scaling computing resources on demand.</li>
            <li>Hosting websites and applications.</li>
            <li>Analyzing big data.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2 id="cloud-limitations">Cloud limitations</h2>
        <p>Cloud computing provides scalable, on-demand resources, but it’s not without limitations. It requires a reliable internet connection, can have higher long-term costs, and raises concerns about data security and privacy.</p>
        <h2 id="cloud-lifespan">Cloud lifespan</h2>
        <p>Cloud's lifespan” is about its ability to consistently run software across various environments. The durability of data in the cloud is often measured in “nines”. For instance, Amazon S3 and Google Cloud Platform claim 11 nines, or 99.999999999% annual durability, meaning if you store 1 million objects for 10 million years, you’d expect to lose 1 file. Durability can vary, so regular monitoring and maintenance are recommended.</p>

        <p>This term tech factor rating is <strong>2/10</strong> where <span class="bold">2</span> means this is a very common term, easy to understand.</p>
