        <p class="p-left-border">A spider is an eight-legged creature known for spinning intricate webs. In the digital world, a <MadCap:keyword term="spider" />‘spider’ is a program that visits websites and reads their pages and other information to create entries for a search engine index.</p>
        <p>A spider in IT, also known as a web crawler, is an Internet bot that systematically browses the World Wide Web, typically for the purpose of Web indexing. Web search engines and some other websites use Web crawling or spidering software to update their web content or indices of other sites’ web content. Spiders can also be used for automating maintenance tasks on a website, such as checking links or validating HTML code.</p>
        <p>When working with spiders, it’s important to understand the following :</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Web Crawling</b>: Spiders, also known as web crawlers, are used in IT to systematically browse the internet for the purpose of indexing or data mining. They can be programmed to visit websites and read their pages and other information to create entries for a search engine index.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Respecting Robots.txt</b>: Spiders should be programmed to respect the rules set out in a website’s robots.txt file. This file tells spiders which parts of the site should not be crawled.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Handling Data</b>: The data collected by spiders can be vast and varied. It’s important to have a system in place for sorting and analyzing this data, such as a database or a data warehousing solution.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Legal Considerations</b>: There are legal considerations when using spiders. For instance, some websites explicitly disallow web scraping in their terms of service.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Efficiency and Performance</b>: Spiders can put a significant load on a website’s server. Therefore, they need to be designed to work efficiently and without causing disruption to the normal functioning of the site.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The five purposes spiders serve for :</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Crawling websites.</li>
            <li>Indexing web pages for search engines.</li>
            <li>Checking links on a website.</li>
            <li>Gathering data from websites.</li>
            <li>Automating maintenance tasks on a website.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2 id="spiders-limitations">Spiders limitations</h2>
        <p>While spiders are essential for search engines, they can put a strain on server resources if not managed properly. They may also inadvertently index sensitive information if it’s not properly protected.</p>
        <h2 id="spiders-lifespan">Spiders lifespan</h2>
        <p>In IT, a “spider” is a software program that systematically browses the internet for the purpose of web indexing. Its “lifespan” or “durability” is about its ability to consistently execute tasks across different computing environments. The active runtime of a spider can vary significantly, from milliseconds to the entire duration of an application’s runtime. Spiders are designed to be ephemeral, meaning they can be stopped, destroyed, and recreated with minimal setup, contrasting with traditional servers or virtual machines that have longer, measured lifespans.</p>
