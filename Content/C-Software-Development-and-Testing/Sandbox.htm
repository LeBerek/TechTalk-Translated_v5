        <p class="p-left-border">In a everyday life context, a sandbox is a safe playground for children to explore and experiment without any real-world consequences. Drawing a parallel to IT, a <MadCap:keyword term="sandbox" />‘sandbox’ is a secure and isolated environment used for testing new software or code, ensuring that any potential errors or vulnerabilities do not impact the larger system.</p>
        <p>A ‘sandbox’ as a secure and isolated environment is used mainly for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Testing new code changes.</li>
            <li>Experimenting with software.</li>
            <li>Isolating untested code from production.</li>
            <li>Debugging software issues.</li>
            <li>Learning new programming languages or technologies.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The five purposes a 'sandbox' plays a crucial role in safeguarding systems and data are :</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Block malicious links.</li>
            <li>Fight malicious attachments.</li>
            <li>Avoid zero-day threats.</li>
            <li>Keep information and data secure.</li>
            <li>Prevent data breaches.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>While sandboxed applications provide a secure environment for testing and development, they do come with certain limitations. Not all programs can be sandboxed. A ban of command line input might be among drawbacks of sandboxing apps, due to the fact that such commands run at a system level. Backup programs and keyboard shotcut managers may not be granted sufficient permissions to function correctly and thus they may limit the capabilities of an application.</p>
        <p>In IT, a “sandbox” is an isolated testing environment. Its “lifespan” or “durability” is not about physical longevity, but its ability to consistently execute software across different environments. The active runtime of a sandbox can vary widely, from milliseconds to the entire duration of an application’s runtime. Sandboxes are designed to be ephemeral, meaning they can be stopped, destroyed, and recreated with minimal setup, contrasting with traditional servers or virtual machines that have longer, measured lifespans.</p>
