        <p class="p-left-border">Think of an IT bug as a mosquito in your room at night. Just as the mosquito’s buzz and bite disrupt your sleep, a <MadCap:keyword term="bug" />bug in a computer program disrupts its smooth operation, causing unexpected results. And just like you would seek to find and remove the mosquito, programmers seek to find and fix bugs to restore the program’s proper function.</p>
        <p>In the realm of computing, a bug is an error in a software program that can lead to unexpected behavior or program termination. This could range from a minor issue like an unresponsive button to a major one causing the program to crash due to an infinite calculation or memory leak. From a developer’s viewpoint, bugs are syntax or logic errors in the program’s source code, often rectified using a tool called a debugger. However, if these errors aren’t detected before the program is compiled into the final application, they become noticeable to the user.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Miscommunication or Lack of Communication: Miscommunication or lack of communication during various stages of the software development process can make defects go unnoticed and/or unreported.</li>
            <li>Human Errors: Humans are prone to errors and quite naturally, expecting the products they develop to be flawless and without errors/defects would be foolish.</li>
            <li>Impractical Development Timeframe: Insufficient or limited resources, unrealistic release schedules, and project deadlines often lead to certain compromises, which can increase the chances of bugs/errors.</li>
            <li>Faulty Design Logic: Faulty application of technology, improper understanding of the technical viability before designing the architecture, the need/temptation to take the fastest and easiest route to implement a solution etc – all can make errors/bugs to creep in.</li>
            <li>Bad Coding Practices: This involves bad coding practices such as unhandled errors, missing exceptions, and faulty validations of inputs together with the use of bad tools.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="durability">Durability</h2>
        <p>In IT, a “bug” is an error or flaw in a computer program that leads to incorrect or unexpected results. Its “durability” refers to how long it persists in the system before it’s discovered and fixed. The lifespan of a bug can vary greatly, some are detected and resolved during development, while others may persist post-release, even for years. The cost of fixing a bug increases the longer it remains undetected due to potential additional errors it may cause. Thus, early detection and resolution of bugs is beneficial.</p>
        <h3 id="the-tech-factor">The Tech Factor</h3>
        <p>This term tech factor rating is <strong>4/10</strong> where <span class="bold">4</span> means the term is not used everyday, but still it is important to know.</p>
