        <p class="p-left-border">A pipeline is a series of pipes used to transport fluids such as water or oil in the real world. In the IT world, a <MadCap:keyword term="pipeline" />‘pipeline’ refers to a set of data processing elements connected in series, where the output of one element is the input of the next.</p>
        <p>When working with pipelines, it’s important to understand the following :</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A pipeline refers to the logical queue filled with instructions for the computer processor to process in parallel.</li>
            <li>It is the process of storing and queuing tasks and instructions.</li>
            <li>These are executed simultaneously by the processor in an organized way.</li>
            <li>It helps in efficient execution of tasks.</li>
            <li>It is a fundamental concept in modern computing architectures.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Take a look at the future example on managing and automating the pipeline.<br />An example of  <a href="https://bovi-analytics.github.io/BigDataForDairyResearch/big-data/#Pipeline" title="Pipeline elements and process flow. " alt="Link to the web page with image of pipeline elements and process flow. ">Managing and automating the pipeline in machine learning.</a></p>
        <p>Five tasks that a pipeline in IT serves for :</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Data Processing: A pipeline in computing is a set of data processing elements connected in series. The output of one element is the input of the next one.</li>
            <li>Executing Instructions in Parallel: The elements of a pipeline are often executed in parallel or in time-sliced fashion. This allows for efficient execution of tasks.</li>
            <li>Buffering: Some amount of buffer storage is often inserted between elements in a pipeline. This helps in managing the flow of data and instructions.</li>
            <li>Building Automation: In the context of software development and deployment, a task in a pipeline is the building block for defining automation. A task is simply a packaged script or procedure that has been abstracted with a set of inputs.</li>
            <li>Managing Task Sequence: When you run a job, all the tasks in a pipeline are run in sequence, one after the other. This ensures that the tasks are executed in the correct order.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2 id="pipeline-limitations">Pipeline limitations</h2>
        <p>In IT, pipelines can be complex to set up and maintain, especially with large data sets. They may also suffer from performance issues if not properly optimized, and errors in one stage can propagate through the pipeline, causing widespread problems.</p>
        <h2 id="pipeline-lifespan">Pipeline lifespan</h2>
        <p>In IT, a “pipeline” refers to a sequence of data processing elements, with the output of one element serving as the input for the next. Its “lifespan” or “durability” is about its ability to consistently execute tasks across different computing environments. The active runtime of a pipeline can vary significantly, from milliseconds to the entire duration of an application’s runtime. In tools like Jenkins, a pipeline’s “durability” can be configured to balance performance and the ability to resume after an unexpected restart.</p>
        <h3 id="the-tech-factor">The Tech Factor</h3>
        <p>This term tech factor rating is <strong>8/10</strong> where <span class="bold">8</span> means
advanced term, that may be difficult for the average user to understand.</p>
