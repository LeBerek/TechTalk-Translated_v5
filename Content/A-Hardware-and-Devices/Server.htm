        <p class="p-left-border">A <MadCap:keyword term="server" />server, in the human sense, is an individual that caters to the needs of others, much like a waiter attending to diners in a restaurant. In the IT world, a server mirrors this role. It is a piece of computer hardware or software that caters to the needs of other programs or devices, known as ‘clients’, serving up data. This could be in the form of data services, such as storing, retrieving, and sending data, or in the form of resource sharing, such as processing power or network bandwidth. Servers are a fundamental part of the modern internet and local networks</p>
        <p>While working with a server, it’s important to understand the following :</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A server is a piece of computer hardware or software that provides functionality for other programs or devices, called “clients”.</li>
            <li>A single server can serve multiple clients, and a single client can use multiple servers.</li>
            <li>A server can be delivered as a hardware appliance, as software, or software as a service (SaaS).</li>
            <li>Typical servers are database servers, file servers, mail servers, print servers, web servers, game servers, and application servers.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="durability">Durability</h2>
        <p>The average lifespan of a server in IT varies depending on the quality of its components, how often it’s used, and how well it’s maintained.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>According to an analyst firm’s findings, the likely lifespan of servers is within 7-10 years.</li>
            <li>Other sources claim servers tend to last between 5-8 years if stored in a clean environment.</li>
        </ul>
