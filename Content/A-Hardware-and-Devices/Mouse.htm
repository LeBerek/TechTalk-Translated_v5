        <p class="p-left-border">A <MadCap:keyword term="mouse" />mouse is a common device that we use to interact with our computers. It is called a mouse because it looks like a small animal with a cord as its tail. However, some mice are wireless, so they don't have tails..</p>
        <p>When using a mouse, it’s important to understand the following :</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A mouse is a peripheral device used to interact with the graphical user interface of a computer.</li>
            <li>It controls the movement of the cursor or pointer on a display screen.</li>
            <li>A mouse can have one or more buttons to allow users to select options, manipulate objects, and create commands.</li>
            <li>The settings of a mouse such as the functions of its buttons, its pointer’s visibility, and the scroll speed of its wheel can be customized.</li>
            <li>Some mice also include additional features like additional buttons, scroll wheels, or trackballs.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="durability">Durability</h2>
        <p>Averages and actual lifespans of a mouse can vary based on the quality of its components, how often it’s used, and how well it’s maintained. Generally, a computer mouse lasts for four to five years. But for the computer mouse used every so often, it might last only for 18-24 months.</p>
        <h2 id="a-matter-of-grammar" MadCap:conditions="Default.PrintOnly">A matter of grammar</h2>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Default.PrintOnly">When we talk about more than one mouse, we can use either "mice" or "mouses" as the plural form. Both words are correct, but "mouses" is technically more appropriate because "mice" is the plural form for living animals. However, most people prefer to say "mice" because it sounds better.</p>
