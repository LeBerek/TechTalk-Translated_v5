In IT, a ‘firewall’ is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.</p>
        <p>When working with firewall, it’s important to understand the following :</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A firewall is a network security device that monitors incoming and outgoing network traffic.</li>
            <li>It allows or blocks traffic based on a defined set of security rules.</li>
            <li>Firewalls provide security at the perimeter by monitoring incoming and outgoing data packets in network traffic for malware and anomalies.</li>
            <li>A firewall can be delivered as a hardware appliance, as software, or software as a service (SaaS).</li>
            <li>There are five main types of firewalls depending upon their operational method: stateless or packet filtering firewall, stateful inspection firewall, circuit-level gateway, application-level gateway, next-generation firewall (NGFW).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>5 Tasks a firewall need to do:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Defend resources</li>
            <li>Validate access</li>
            <li>Manage and control network traffic</li>
            <li>Record and report on events</li>
            <li>Act as an intermediary</li>
        </ol>
        <h2 id="firewall-limitations">Firewall limitations</h2>
        <p>Firewalls, while crucial for network security, can sometimes block legitimate traffic due to overzealous rules. They also require constant updates to keep up with new threats, and can’t protect against threats from within the network.</p>
        <h2 id="firewall-lifespan">Firewall lifespan</h2>
        <p>In IT, a “firewall” is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic. Its “lifespan” isn’t typically measured in temporal terms, but rather by its ability to adapt to new threats and maintain system security. A firewall remains effective as long as it is properly updated and configured to deal with evolving cybersecurity threats. Therefore, you could say its lifespan is essentially as long as it continues to effectively protect the network it’s safeguarding.</p>
        <h3 id="the-tech-factor">The Tech Factor</h3>
        <p>This term tech factor rating is <strong>5/10</strong> where <span class="bold">5</span> means
the term is somewhat technical, but still considered basic computing terminology.</p>
