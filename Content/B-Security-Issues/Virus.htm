        <p class="p-left-border" style="border-left-style: solid;border-left-width: 4px;border-left-color: #ff8c00;padding-left: 10px;">In biology, a virus is a microscopic parasite that can infect living organisms and cause disease. In computing, a ‘virus’ is a type of malicious software that, when executed, replicates by reproducing itself or infecting other programs by modifying them.</p>
        <p>A <MadCap:keyword term="virus" />virus in IT is a type of malicious software that, when executed, replicates itself by modifying other computer programs and inserting its own code. When this replication succeeds, the affected areas are then said to be “infected”. Viruses can cause harmful effects such as stealing hard disk space or CPU time, accessing private information, corrupting data, displaying political or humorous messages on the user’s screen, spamming their contacts, logging their keystrokes, or even rendering the computer useless.</p>
        <p>When dealing with viruses, it’s important to understand the following :</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A virus is a fragment of code embedded in a legitimate program.</li>
            <li>Viruses are self-replicating and are designed to infect other programs.</li>
            <li>They can wreak havoc in a system by modifying or destroying files causing system crashes and program malfunctions.</li>
            <li>A virus operates by inserting or attaching itself to a legitimate program or document that supports macros in order to execute its code.</li>
            <li>Viruses are harmful and can destroy data, slow down system resources, and log keystrokes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Five purposes viruses are created for:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Infecting computer systems.</li>
            <li>Spreading to other computers.</li>
            <li>Damaging data or software.</li>
            <li>Stealing sensitive information.</li>
            <li>Disrupting computer operations.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2 id="virus-limitations">Virus limitations</h2>
        <p>Viruses in IT are inherently destructive and can cause significant damage to systems and data. However, they are limited by their need to be executed to cause harm, and modern antivirus software can often detect and neutralize them.</p>

        <h2 id="virus-lifespan">Virus lifespan</h2>
        <p>In IT, a “virus” is a malicious software that replicates by altering other programs. Its “lifespan” or “durability” refers to its ability to persist in a system until detected and removed. This lifespan can vary significantly, with some viruses being detected and removed quickly, while others may remain undetected for years. The goal of IT security is to minimize this lifespan by detecting and removing viruses as swiftly as possible.</p>
